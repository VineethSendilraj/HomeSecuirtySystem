# HomeSecuirtySystem
I built an IOT Home Security System with sensors reading whether the door or window is open or closed. If it is open it will turn on a visual red light and sound an alarm. If it is closed it will turn off the alarm and turn on a visual green light. Whatever the data is, the Arduino will send it to the RaspberryPi and it will send it to Google Firebase. From there, I built a simple Web App to display this information. It can then be converted to a mobile web app from the browser by selecting save to home screen. 
This can be replecated by watching my YouTube Video:
